                        <p>
                            Remote recording has revolutionised the way musicians 
                            collaborate, allowing them to create and share music 
                            easily despite geographical barriers.  <br><br>

                            As travel costs rise and schedules become more hectic, 
                            artists can leverage advanced technology and online 
                            platforms to write and produce music in real-time, 
                            enabling remote collaborations that allow artists to 
                            work together from different locations while still 
                            achieving high-quality results. This does not only 
                            enhances accessibility, but also opens the door to a 
                            diverse range of influences and ideas.

                    <p>
                        - Get in touch via email or phone to discuss the details of 
                        your project. 
                        <br><br>
                        - I'll provide a quote for the session based on your needs for 
                        the project.
                        <br><br>
                        - Once the details and pricing are agreed on, you'll send over 
                        a folder containing a guide track (with drums) and a drumless 
                        copy of the track. Be sure to add any notes or references you 
                        require for your track.

                        aim to recreate that based on the guide track. Otherwise
                        I will work on creating a drum part that best compliments 
                        the feel of the track.
                        <br><br>
                        - Once i've recorded a take i'm happy with, I'll send you 
                        a rough mix with the track to preview. I will also work 
                        with you to make any changes you wish to make up to a 
                        maximum of 3 revisions.

                        the take, I'll prep the drum stems/files and go through 
                        final details to ensure everything is in place.
                        <br><br>
                        - I'll send over an invoice for the project. This will

                        <br><br>
