## Overview

My chosen project idea is to create a website for a professional session musician.

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Click Here!](https://t3mmy4p.github.io/milestone-project-1/)


The user targets for this project are; Music Directors, Music Agencies, Recording Studios and Independent Artists 

  
### Aim?

As a working musician and music director, sometimes trying to find the right musicians for a project can be daunting without proper vetting i.e holding an audition. However it is very common that the timeframe for a partical project might not allow for such formalities and this is where having an online presence comes in. Although you'd think this would make the process easier, it only makes things more complicated. I came to the conclusion that the reason for this is majority of musician websites are overloaded with too much information.

As a personal project I wanted to create a simple site that would stand out to a music professional, agency, or independent artist visually while still offering enough information. 


## Features

### Home Page
    
The header is a black background to help the gold logo and brand name stand out. Clicking the logo & brand name brings your back to the home page.

The home page serves as a cool welcome with the users attention being captivated by the hero image. 

I used a similar yellowish/gold for the font of the job title to give the page a theme around the gold logo.

The audio player acts as a little preview for site users to get an idea of the sound and ability of the musician.

The about me section gives the user a quick intro and bio about the musician's background, experience, and musical range.

![About Me](./assets/images/screenshots/About%20me%20screenshot.png)

The video section gives the users a visual represenation of the musician's ability and versatility. The book now button turns yellow when hovered on to keep with the theme and is linked to the contact page for the user to book the musician immediately.

The footer is a simple style 3 icon design for easy links to the musician's social media platforms for more information.

### Services Page   

The services page keeps the same color coding as the home page for the sections. A background with a transparent ovelay for the first section to give a visually warm background to add some color to the page and serve as a background for the page intro. 

The how it works heading has a yellow underline to keep with the theme around the logo. This section is an intro intro remote recording for those who are new to the idea.

The next section breaks down the process of how remote recording work with a button directing users to the contact page when clicked. Button turns yellowsish/gold when hovered on to keep with the theme.

The other services section brings the users attention to a brief info card on the other services offered. Each info card has a yellow underline to keep with the main theme of the site and also had it's own button directing users to the contact page.

### Gallery Page

The gallery is a simple 3 column style layout with a mix of black and white and warm colored photos to give the page some colour while still complimenting the theme of the site.

### Contact Page

The contact page is a simple layout with a white background and grey-ish input boxed that turn yellow/gold when clicked/focussed.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup: Used to create a basic website layout
- CSS custom properties: Used to create captivating front end design for positive user experience
- Balsamiq: Used to create wireframes


### What I learned



Diving deep into flex-box and learning how the different properties worked especially vertical alignment helped to make the coding process a lot smoother. 

Using media queries also opened my eyes to various way to play around with responsive design. I still have a long way to fo in mastering it but I intend to keep practicing by working on more practice projects.


### Continued development

- I'm hoping to continue working on the design, especially the stylesheet to make it a lot more simplified and easier to read.

- I intend to find an easier to add video files by having a screenshot of the video that links to a site hosting the videos when clicked

- The drop down menu in the responsive design could look a lot more appealing. I intend to use java script to create a better looking drop down menu.

### Testing

- After pushing the project to github, some of the text and boxes were out of line but easily fixed with minimal tweaks in the stylesheet.

- Home page take a little longer to load due to large image files. Remformatted the image files for quicker load time

- The text rendered differently on a chrome desktop signed into a different account

- Some of the css styling renders to apple default styling on apple devices e.g drop down menu has rounded borders, audio player appears more slimline and in dark color.

- Push attempt error
  - I encoutered major issues trying to push my project up to github due to the sizes of the videos used at the start of the project. Unfortunately after trying various failed attempts to get around the problem, I ultimately had to remove the .git folder which was roughly about (800MB) and make a fresh commit.

Please see below screenshots of errors encountered;

### Bugs
- Text renders differently when project is opened in different chrome accounts

### Deployment

The site was deployed to Git Hub pages using the following steps:

- In the Github repository, the Stetting tab.
- Under General, navigate to Code and Automation and select 'Pages'.
- In the Build and Deployment section for Source, select 'Deploy from a branch' from the drop-down list.
- For Branch, select 'main' from the drop-down list and Save.
- On the top of the page, the link to the complete website is provided.
- The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch.
