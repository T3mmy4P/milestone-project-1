## Overview

My chosen project idea is to create a website for a professional session musician. 

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)


The user targets for this project are; Music Directors, Music Agencies, Recording Studios and Independent Artists 

  
### Aim?

As a working musician and music director, I find sometimes trying to find the right musicians for a project can be daunting without proper vetting i.e holding an audition. However it is very common that the timeframe for a partical project might not allow for such formalities and this is where having an online presence comes in. Although you'd think this would make the process easier, it only makes things more complicated. I came to the conclusion that the reason for this is majority of musician websites are either overloaded with way too much information.

As a personal project I wanted to create a site that would stand out to a music professional, agency, or independent artist visually while still offering enough information.

## Features

### Home Page

The home page serves as a cool welcome with the users attention being captivated by the hero image. 
    
The header is a black background to help the gold logo and brand name stand out. Clicking the logo & brand name brings your back to the home page.

I used a similar yellowish/gold for the font of the job title to give the page a theme around the gold logo.

The audio player acts as a little preview for site users to get an idea of the sound and ability of the musician.

The about me section gives the user a quick intro and bio about the musician's background, experience, and musical range.

The video section gives the users a visual represenation of the musician's ability and versatility. The book now button turns yellow when hovered on to keep with the theme and is linked to the contact page for the user to book the musician immediately.

The footer is a simple style 3 icon design for easy links to the musician's social media platforms for more information.

### Services Page   

The services page keeps the same color coding as the home page for the sections. A background with a transparent ovelay for the first section to give a visually warm background to add some color to the page and serve as a background for the page intro. 

The how it works heading has a yellow underline to keep with the theme around the logo. This section is an intro intro remote recording for those who are new to it

The next section breaks down the process of how remote recording work with a button directing users to the contact page when clicked. Button turns yellowsish/gold when hovered on to keep with the theme. 

The other services section brings the users attention to a brief info card on the other services offered. Each info card has a yellow underline to keep with the main theme of the site and also had it's own button directing users to the contact page.

### Gallery Page

The gallery is a simple 3 column style layout with a mix of black and white and warm colored photos to give the page some colour while still complimenting the theme of the site.

### Contact Page

The contact page is a simple layout with a white background and grey-ish input boxed that turn yellow/gold when clicked/focussed

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

Started by writing out the basic code for the header and footer and styled in css. Once styled, I copied and pasted the code into the other pages for consistency.

- Index Page

I found I spent the most time on this page than the others througout the project. Especially on styling the about me section due to my limited understanding of css. My inital idea was to put the image and text in two seperate containers inside another container to allow me control them better. However I found I was creating more problems for myself by making it too complicated. 

After doing some studying on css flex and grid it gave me the tools I needed to achieve my goal for that section and the rest of the project. 


- Services Page

In terms of html code, this page was probably the most straight forward, as I had a better level of understanding of css rules and properties which meant I was able to nest my codes without having to add excess elements or create unecessary containers and classes.

The only major challenge I faced on this page was trying to add an overlay on the image. I able to get around that by nesting a container with a transparent background on background image.

- Gallery Page

This was very straight forward to code with the help of W3schools. 

- Contact Page 

This was also very straight forward page, just a simple contact form.


- CSS custom properties

This project really pushed me to do improve my knowledge on css, with the help of practice projects from Front End Mentor, W3scools documentation, Personal practice, youtube videos, mimo and other documentations. 

The css code really shows my progress. It looks pretty messy due to starting on limited knowledge, I found myself trying to rewrite a lof of code I wrote at the start as they didn't make sense after doing some more studying. However I decided to leave a lot of them in as it gives me something to work on in the project on a long term basis.

Media queries were something else I had to really study on. It also exposed some my mistakes in terms of my design approach. It was clear I didn't follow the mobile first approach which meant using a lot css rules in my media queries. I intend to work on tidying up and simplyfying the media queries over time.

- Flexbox

Understanding how flexbox works helped make working on the project so much easier. It opened my eyes to a different approach to coding, creating and manipulating containers/boxes. 

It meant I was able to create what I wanted and manipulate them with ease. There's still a lot to learn but flexbox was the key to majority of this project.


### What I learned

Flexbox and Media Queries have to be the biggest highlight for me. 

Diving deep into flex-box and learning how the different properties worked especially vertical alignment helped to make the coding process a lot smoother. 

Using media queries also opened my eyes to various way to play around with responsive design. I still have a long way to fo in mastering it but I intend to keep practicing by working on more practice projects.


### Continued development

I'm hoping to continue working on the design, especially the stylesheet to make it a lot more simplified and easier to read.

The drop down menu in the responsive design could look a lot more appealing. I intend to use java script to create a better looking drop down menu.



### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
